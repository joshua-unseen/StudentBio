            I take things apart and put them back together.  Most of the time they work better when I'm finished.<br>
            Ten years ago, I fixed up a basket-case '85 Yamaha, stacked 100 lbs worth of my belongings on the back, and rode it across the country.
            In the winter.  The next time, I'll wait for spring.  Or maybe fall.<br>
            I've been working with computers for quite some time now.  Currently I run several virtual servers on an old Dell PowerEdge frame in my living room, 
            and tinker with a small collection of out-of-date laptops.<br>
            I'm looking forward to making a transition into coding.
